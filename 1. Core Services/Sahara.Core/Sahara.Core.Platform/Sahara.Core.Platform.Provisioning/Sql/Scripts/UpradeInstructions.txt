When schemas are to be upgraded:

1. Most work will be done using the Sahara.Core.Schema.Upgrades CloudeService & Worker
2. The new schema must be merged into the "Initialization" folder. So new accounts have the latest schemas when provisioined.
3. Initialization > Seed > SchemaLog.sql > Version must be logged to so that it reflects the new version number and to reflect new account schema versions.
4. A worker role called "Upgrade Worker" is designed to update existing accounts to the new schema in batches of 10, 100 or 1,000 every day until complete.
5. The upgrade worker can be part of the Core Services solution in order to use all the libraries, but it can be packaged as a seperate instance and run as an isolated worker from the Core Services package.
6. Log table must be updated with the time and version number upgraded to per account.
